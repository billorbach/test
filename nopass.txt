Copy the public key just generated to all of your remote Linux boxes.
 You can use scp or FTP or whatever to make the copy. 
Assuming you're using root--again, see my warning in step 1--the key must be contained in the file /root/.ssh/authorized_keys.
In our case it is /.ssh/authorized_keys rather than /root/.ssh/authorized_keys.
If you are having a problem with ssh then regenerate the key again.

 Or, if you are logging in as a user, for example, clyde, it would be in /home/clyde/authorized_keys. 
Notice that the authorized_keys file can contain keys from other PCs. 
So, if the file already exists and contains text, you need to append the contents of your public key file to what already is there.
