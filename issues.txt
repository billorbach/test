iIn general, if there is a problem, the first thing to check is whether jeos or www-data
can log on to the esxi server without a password.
Esxi deletes the .ssh directory on rebooting which means all scripts will fail to run
since they will need a password. if that is the case, you will have to use keygen
again or copy the files from a directory which has not been deleted such as /vmfs/volumes/Storage/..ssh

Problem that ESXI server sees the configuration of the clones differently than what we see on disk and this leads to all
sorts of mismatches. So modified web-create-clone1.sh and web-edit-master2.sh so that they unregister the clones before modifying their *.vmx
files and then reregister them and restart them if they have been running. This may mess up the id which may then mess up the controller program.

In order to prevent the error with the clone not getting the right version of the master vmdk after edit or create master, we need to make sure that when
we click edit setting and check the version, we must make sure to hit cancel, not okay. When you hit okay, it rewrites the vmx file with the wrong version
number. So always hit cancel after edit settings.
